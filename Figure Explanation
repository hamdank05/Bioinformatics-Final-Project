### The figure shows the correlation between different samples of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* in gene expression levels under varying times of 1M sorbitol stress treatment.
The time points of treatment included 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. 
Samples included wild type and mutant yeast (missing gene atf21)
The color scale represented strength of correlation (The darker the color the higher the correlation)
Branches were clustered acoording to gene expression similarities
