## The figure shows the relative fold change between different samples of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* in gene expression levels under varying times of 1M sorbitol stress treatment.

The time points of treatment included 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. 

Samples included wild type and mutant yeast (missing gene atf21)

The color scale represented level of gene expression change (The lighter the color the higher the change)

Branches were clustered according to gene expression similarities
